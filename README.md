ALIX - St Aldates In-House AMX Replacement
==========================================

Configuration and Miscellaneous Notes
-------------------------------------

### INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION ###

You will need a Python (2.7 is what I've used) with python-serial, PySide, and
Pyro4 . Ubuntu packages all but Pyro4: you'll need to `easy_install` it to get
the right version.

You'll also need the Tango icon theme installed - it needs to be under
`/usr/share/icons/Tango`. This is where the tango-icon-theme package gets
installed to.

Mapping of physical hardware devices through serial ports to virtual devices is
done in the `runController.py` script. Be sure to map devices based on their USB
device path - `/dev/ttyUSBx`'es might get swapped round after a reboot, which
would be sad. Everything GUI-side refers to the name string you assign to each
device, so balance these between descriptive and concise.


### RUNNING ###

You will need a Pyro4 nameserver running somewhere on your network. The 
`runNameserver.sh` script will take care of this for you, or use the
`contrib/pyro-nsd` init script for Debian (maybe others?)

The machine with all the serial ports on it will need to run the 
`runController.py` script. The machine with the GUI should run the `AldatesX.py`
script. They don't have to be different machines. The GUI should automatically
discover the controller via the Pyro nameserver, no need to manually configure
IP addresses and whatnot.
